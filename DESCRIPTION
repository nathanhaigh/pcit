Description: Apply Partial Correlation coefficient with Information
        Theory (PCIT) to a correlation matrix.
        The PCIT algorithm identifies meaningful correlations to define
        edges in a weighted network. The algorithm can be applied to
        any correlation-based network including but not limited to gene
        co-expression networks.
        To reduce compute time by making use of multiple compute cores,
        simply run PCIT on a computer with has multiple cores and also
        has the Rmpi package installed. PCIT will then auto-detect the
        multicore environment and run in parallel mode without the need
        to rewrite your scripts. This makes scripts, using PCIT, portable
        across single core (or no Rmpi package installed) computers
        which will run in serial mode and multicore (with Rmpi package
        installed) computers which will run in parallel mode.
