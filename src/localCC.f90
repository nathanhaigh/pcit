! Based on the following equation: C_i = E_i/[k_i(k_i-1)/2]
!	Where: C_i is the clustering coef of node i
!	       E_i is the sum of the abs adjacencies that exists between direct neighbours of node i
!	       k_i is the number of direct neighbours of node i
!	k_i(k_i - 1)/2 is the maximum possible sum of abs adjacencies that could exist between the direct neighbours of node i.
